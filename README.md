# MQTT Workshop for Wemos D1

This is a simple workshop that shows how to use MQTT on the famous Wemos D1.
We will build up a publisher that has a DS18B20 as digital temperature sensor and a receiver that will print the reading on a I²C LCD and switch on the light up the built-in LED if the temperature rises above 30 °C.
